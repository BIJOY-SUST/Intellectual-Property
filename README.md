Our Goal is to develop a software which can verify Intellectual Property’s ownership using Blockchain. We intend to use private Blockchain/Hyperledger Fabric for this purpose.

This project is done by me and saba. In the project, all the files were uploaded by me, cause we face some sync problems. But we worked together.

##### Overview
IP or intellectual property refers to anything created using one’s intellect such as a poem, an art, a business plan, inventions and so on. IP is protected by law in the form of patents, trademarks, and copyrights, which help the owner to earn recognition and financial benefits from their creations. With the ease of availability of the Internet, it has become very easy to copy digital assets. In our project, we use blockchain(Hyperledger Fabric) to verify the ownership of intellectual property and provide the facility of transaction of these IP between users.

##### Product Description
This section points out the functions and facilities provided by our project
  - One can upload two types of intellectual property
    -Image

  - One can react on another person’s IP
  - Two lists are provided in the UI
    - Top Influential People - Sorts all the registered users by the no. of IP they uploaded.
    - Popular Intellectual Property - Shows a list with the users whose IP have received most reactions from other users.
  - If a user tries to upload an intellectual Property which has already been uploaded by another user, the system shows error and shows the name of the owner.
  - One can buy or sell an intellectual property from/to another user.
  - A user can search intellectual properties by the name of their owner.
  - There’s a feed which is distinct for every user. Because it only shows one’s own intellectual property.
  - A log is maintained for each intellectual property to keep track of from which user one has bought the IP.
  - A profile is maintained for every user where
    - The no. of owned Intellectual Property
    - User’s balance (only shows for logged in user)
